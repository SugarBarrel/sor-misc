## Mechanics

You can use spilled blood or blood from the flask to do rituals. Spilled blood will be in the form of separate objects. Recognizing various shapes other than circles might get complicated.



## Items

Item **Blood Flask**
> Cultist's starting item. When in inventory, a display similar to Money's appears in the UI. Can store blood. Capacity: 100 units. Can be used from the toolbar to collect blood puddles on the ground (inefficient, just 50%). Maybe there'll be a way of collecting blood from various creatures.

Item **Bottomless *(but not really)* Flask**
> An upgraded flask with a capacity of 150. Upgradable via a ritual.

Item **Ritual Knife**
> Cultist's starting item. Unbreakable maybe (to be used in the Cuthroat ritual)? Can be used as a weapon, damage less than a Knife's. Can be used to perform rituals on/with corpses.

Item **Candle**
> Cheap one-use item, that can be dropped on the ground and lit with a cigarette lighter or anything firey. Required for some top-tier rituals or maybe increases their efficiency.

Item **Kapala** (ref. Spelunky)
> Can be filled with a blood flask. 1 unit of blood â†’ 1 HP.

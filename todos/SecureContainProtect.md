## Done

- SCP-005 - Skeleton Key:
  - can unlock any recognizable locking mechanism, be it mechanical, digital, fictional or meta-existential.
- SCP-096 - The Shy Guy:
  - kills everyone who at some point saw its face. Unstoppable, even by steel walls, and will always catch you eventually.
- SCP-426 - I'm a Toaster:
  - I'm just a regular toaster. My secondary effects take way too long to manifest.
- SCP-504 - Critical Tomatoes:
  - sometimes get thrown at people making jokes, while on the ground or in the toolbar.
  - the power is determined at random.
  - can be eaten to restore health ~~without any side effects~~; if you tell a bad joke within several minutes of consumption of SCP-504, you'll explode.



## To-dos (coming soon)

- SCP-096 Photo:
  - triggers SCP-096's effect from a distance.
  - can be shown to NPCs.
- SCP-3521 - Banana Pill:
  - 10-30 seconds after consumption explodes into a rapidly increasing pile of bananas.
  - bananas produced by this will have a limited stack size, so the player can't just absorb several million kilograms of bananas into their inventory.
  - if there's a lot of bananas around some thing, it will get damaged under their sheer pressure (that would affect objects, agents and walls).
- SCRAMBLE Goggles:
  - prevents you from seeing SCP-096's face. Has a 0.1% chance to malfunction every second (~5.8% every minute).



## To-dos (planned)

- SCP-244 - the freezing gas vase:
  - make some autonomous gas clouds that travel in different directions and bounce off the walls, and make some of them house hostile entities that freeze NPCs and put out fires.
- SCP-262 - Coat of Arms:
  - make all arms unique and with different traits.
  - make it work with regular melee weapons.
- SCP-173 - The Statue:
  - everyone's asking, so fine, I'll make it at some point.



## To-dos (unsure)

- a gun that shoots food that the aimed at person ate:
  - NPCs don't eat food, but I guess you can just randomize the stuff they "ate"?



## To-dos (rejected)

- SCP-133 - Instant Holes:
  - they have pretty low penetration, so they're not suitable for spawning holes straight up on the ground; if you use these only for opening doors and safes, they'll be almost identical to SCP-005.
- SCP-428 - The Crowd:
  - implementing a hive mind in SoR is an incredibly difficult task.
- SCP-923 - the psychic satellite:
  - it's just an option on the Satellite Dish, not really interesting or impactful.
- SCP-1936 - UnLondon:
  - it'd have to affect level generation, and I'm a noob in that area.
- Foundation, MTF and GoI:
  - for that I'd have to create an anomaly-oriented AI and unique interactions with all SCPs; you wouldn't want MTFs to be just as helpless as D-class personnel.
